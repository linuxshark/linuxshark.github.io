# WELCOME TO LINUXSHARK RECIPES FOR I.T. & VoIP SURVIVAL

Hello EveryOne,

This place is dedicated for every tech-guy-or-gal who love the Information Technologies (as I do) and want to learn some interesting recipes about common infrastructure and OpenStack cloud computing solutions.

You can (and should) view this page using Github Pages. Link:

[http://linuxshark.github.io](http://linuxshark.github.io "LinuxShark Recipes for I.T. & VoIP Survival")

This repository (and it's github page counterpart) is divided on the following sections:

* [Asterisk:](http://linuxshark.github.io/recipes/asterisk) Everything related to Asterisk VoIP implementations.
* [Linux:](http://linuxshark.github.io/recipes/linux) All linux related stuff.
* [Cloud Computing:](http://linuxshark.github.io/recipes/cloudcomputing) All linux related stuff.

**What's my motivation for doing this ?**
